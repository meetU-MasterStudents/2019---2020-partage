In this directory you can find some examples of foldrec files (ie. input for Downstream).
These foldrecs were generated by ORION software taking as input queries extracted from the benchmark file (see /partage/Data/benchmark_398.txt).
These queries were then compared with ORION against the HOMSTRAD families including their corresponding family. Each output file (i.e. foldrec file) 
are named as ID-query_fam_ID-family.foldrec (P37306.2_fam_aakinase.foldrec).

Now you can start coding your foldrec file parsers!
